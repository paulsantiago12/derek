<td><font font size=5  color="white"> Ever since i was a kid i always wanted to be a part of the world help it become better for the people. So I decided to make this my project because of the potential it carries. the potential on how it will shape our future when everything is digitized. when technology has become a part of
our evolution. Forever curious on threading the needle of impossibility. We often see glasses as nothing more than it is simple and lifeless but i wanted to see more of its potential to help when its abilities is more than just making people see clearly so it became my project to TEST THE LIMITS. </td>
